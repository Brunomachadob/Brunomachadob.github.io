# About me

I'm a knowledge addicted, graduated in Computer Engineering that loves math, physics and astronomy, that happens to also be a passionate Software Engineer.
With almost 10 years of experience in the software development industry, having worked from small startups to big international corporations.

Currently living in Berlin :de:, working for [N26](https://n26.com/en-de), helping them build the bank the world loves to use.

## Hobbies

* :video_game: Gaming, currently adventuring myself on [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim);

## Projects and toy applications

Here you can find some of the projects and toy applications I have been working with

**[Deep Dive into God's Word](https://brunomb.com/ddgw){:target="_blank"}**

This is a study/research compilation of my Bible reading.
My idea is to have a living document that will be updated from time to time according to new understandings, debates with friends and more researches.
I also have plans to use this in quick sessions with people that are interested on learning and debating about it

**[Game Studio Fidelity program](https://brunomb.com/smart-game-discounts){:target="_blank"}**

This is a small toy application showcasing a fidelity program that studios would apply on a market place (Steam for example) 
that would give discounts based on games the users already have in their library.

**[Word Matcher](https://github.com/Brunomachadob/word-matcher){:target="_blank"}**

This is a toy application I created to help me find a valid possible word based in a input that be either
* scrambled (e.g. lolhe wdlro)
* with characters placeholders (e.g. he_lo wo_ld)

I probably shouldn't have done this one, this is kinda cheating the games, right? :grimacing:

**[Spreadsheet processor](https://github.com/Brunomachadob/ProcessadorPlanilha){:target="_blank"} & [Spreadsheet processor view](https://brunomb.com/ProcessadorPlanilhaView/){:target="_blank"}**

This is a application I created for my wife and her coworkers to use in the past.
With this application they could upload spreadsheets that were generated by other processes and do all sorts of transformations on them, including:
* Select which columns they wanted;
* Rename table headers;
* Put selected columns in lowercase or uppercase;
* Remove special characters from columns;
* Adjust phone number to the default format;
* And many other operations

Unfortunately all the project docs are in Portuguese, the way they needed it.
